## usage
this project is based on vitepress, which uses `vite`, `vue`, and `markdown`
in order to make an easily configurable and editable blog-style website.

it depends on `node`, so to get started, you will need to `cd` into the
project folder and run `yarn` (or `npm install`).

once the dependencies are installed, you can run a development copy of
the site locally with `yarn dev` (or `npm run dev`). this has hot reloading,
so it's easy to see how your changes will look without having to reload.

after you've made your changes, you can build them with `yarn build`
(or `npm run build`), and serve the built site with `yarn serve`
or (`npm run serve`).

## contributing
if you're looking to contribute, that's great! you will likely
need to fork the repo, commit your changes, and then submit a
pull request.

all discussion related to the website happens on our discord server,
so if you're looking to contribute it's best that you talk over your
contributions there before putting in the work to make them.

if you're not already a member, you can join from this [invite link][0].

thanks for your interest and contributions!
