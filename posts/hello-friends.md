Hello Friends.

Welcome to the website for the UVic Linux Club!

-----------------------------------------------

At the moment, there isn't much content available, but that will be changing
shortly, as we have big plans!

We will be using this website to post updates on club happenings, such as
events, workshops, and projects.

If you are at all interested in linux, or even tangential topics such as
privacy, open-source software, and digital freedoms, please join our
[discord server][0]! We have members of all levels of familiarity, so
whether you're a complete beginner and have never used linux before and
you're looking for a place to learn or get help, or you're a pro and want 
to show off your impressive arch rice, this is the place for you!
